# Development Log
## Week 1
This week, our goals were to create our team contract, project proposal, a class Schema, a Read.Me, skeleton classes, 
a small dataset to test against, a MakeFile, make the repo, write test cases for the algorithms and configure user input.

**Specific Tasks Completed (and by who):**
- Create our team contract (Megan, Nisha)
- Create our project proposal (All)
- Create a class Schema (Megan, Nisha)
- Make the repo (Akul)
- Create a Read.Me (Megan)
- Create the skeleton classes (Nisha)
- Add documentation to the functions (Megan)
- Create a makefile (Akul, Yesui)
- Write test cases for the algorithms (Akul, Yesui)
- Configure user input (Akul)

Our plans for next week is a very broad overview, but the main goals we want to complete are to read and parse the data, build graph, begin implementing BFS
and Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and highlight what needs to be presented for the midpoint check-in.

## Week 2
This week, our goals is to ingest the data, parse file, build graph, begin implementing BFS and Dijkstra’s Algorithm, 
write test cases for the algorithms to ensure they are working and create a small dataset to test against (at most 20 nodes).

**Specific Tasks Completed (and by who):**
- Ingest the data + parse file (Megan, Nisha)
- Build graph (Megan, Nisha)
- Begin implementing BFS (Nisha)
- Begin implementing Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Akul)
- Write test cases for the data ingest and parsing to ensure it is working (Megan)
- Create a small dataset to test against (at most 20 nodes) (Yesui)
- Makefile fixes (Megan)

Next week, we'll create a documents folder that includes the project proposal, team contract, and then a sub folder that includes every development log, 
begin implementing Betweenness Centrality Algorithm, write test cases for BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm and data sets of varying size and completeness.
