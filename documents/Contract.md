# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings:** 
    
    We will meet once a week, preferably in person but if not possible, then through Discord. This meeting will consist of checking in on our progress.  We’ll evaluate if we have met our weekly goals, if we need help, or if we need to make new goals for the next week.  While we are meeting weekly, every week we discuss progress, but every two weeks we create goals and reflect on what we accomplished. We will record our meeting progress and upcoming goals and targets using Google Docs.

2. **Assistance:**
    
    We’ll be using Discord to communicate.  Since we all frequently use the platform, we’ll ideally respond within 24 hours. We will require each member to check the discord group chat at least once daily. If a person is directly tagged in a message, they must react to the message to confirm they have seen it. For messages that tag everyone, everyone must react to confirm they have seen it. In the case that an urgent opinion is needed, we can also contact each other via SMS or phone call.

3. **Respect:** 
    
    Before we make any major decision, we want to make sure everyone has voiced their opinion and the decision is unanimous.  We can facilitate discussions by inviting others to speak and asking for their thoughts. In order to have a productive conversation we can ensure that we set ground rules for communication and maintain a level of social awareness.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution:** 
    As for work, we will have to have a buddy system of sorts.  Since the data sets are so large, if one person implements, at least one other person needs to test thoroughly.  When there is a huge problem or unforeseen work, it should first be notified through our group chat and especially at the weekly meeting. Based on the issue, we can re-evaluate our weekly goals to either implement paired programming or convene as a group to resolve the issue.


5. **Time Commitment:** 
    
    As a slight overestimate, we expect roughly three hours of work per week.  We know that we have other classwork to do, so we want to be considerate of our time and not overload ourselves. When we write goals, we’ll identify which are critical to accomplish or which goals are needed to be done for others to work on. Since we have set a timeline of two weeks per task, each member should manage their time accordingly. If there are any issues, please inform the group and refer to the conflict resolution passage.

    As a special circumstance, if you cannot make it to the weekly status meeting, it is your responsibility to write up a report beforehand and send it to the group chat to be read during the meeting. It is also your responsibility to catch up by reading the meeting notes.


6. **Conflict Resolution:** 

    When there is a disagreement between members of the group, we can have a level-headed discussion and reach a conclusion. If otherwise unable to, we will contact course staff for advice on the situation. With regards to incomplete work, if it is being held up by bugs then we will assist the person being held up in accordance with the work distribution passage. If work is left incomplete for other reasons outside of valid excuses, then a warning will be given and the deadline will be extended by 3 days. In those three days, the offending party must catch up on their work, write up a report on what they finished, and submit it to the group chat.
